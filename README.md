Program for creating 2D nbt schemes obsidian (and not only) logos for minecraft.

# History of creation
Some time ago, a friend of mine created a Python program that converted a png image into a 2D schematic of an obsidian logo.
Since the nbtlib library was not very optimized, the image conversion process was slow and the output scheme was too large, but
that didn't stop us from using this program to create the scheme and build the obsidian logo on the 2b2t.org.ru server.

After that a few days passed and I got the idea to write this program in Java, so I asked leha59 to explain me what nbt components
the schematic consists of, so that I could come up with something based on that.
To my surprise, instead of a long explanation, he threw me the entire source code of his program (for which he was very grateful).
Immediately on the same day I made the first prototype of the program, which worked much faster and produced much less weighty schemes
than the Python program.

At the time of release, the program is optimized to the limit and also has a couple of useful tweaks such as: image to output schema size ratio, multithreading and custom block palettes.

# How to use
1. Download the files 2DSchematicGenerator-1.0.jar and start.bat(Needed to start the .jar file) from the release.
2. (Preferably) Create a folder where only these files will be stored.
3. Run the program with 'start.bat' and read the README file of the language you need to know what to do next(If you are too lazy to read it, go on with the steps).
4. Place the image file in the newly created 'Include' folder
5. Run the program again using 'start.bat' and wait for the program to finish running.
6. Take the resulting schematic from the 'Output' folder
